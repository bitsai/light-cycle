A simple TRON light cycle game in Clojure, inspired by the Snake example in Programming Clojure and Google's Tron AI Challenge:

Current gameplay is Free-For-All between 2 humans and 2 bots:
- Player 1 controls the yellow light cycle using WASD.
- Player 2 controls the blue light cycle using the arrow keys.
- Right now, the bots are not very smart.  They simply choose a random open adjacent square, with a bias for going straight if possible.

To start the game, assuming . is on the class path, just run light_cycle.clj:
clj light_cycle.clj
