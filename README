Current gameplay is Free-For-All between 2 humans and 2 bots:
- Player 1 controls the yellow light cycle using WASD.
- Player 2 controls the blue light cycle using the arrow keys.
- Bots will randomly choose an open square, with a bias for going straight.

To start the game, assuming . is on the class path, just run light-cycle.clj:
clj light-cycle.clj
